# Cartwheel

A tiny cart and checkout API: products, carts, coupons, totals, checkout. In-memory, no database, no auth.

Cartwheel is the product in the **[Closed Loop](https://github.com/Sumit-Saurabh98/closed-loop)** demo, where users report Cartwheel bugs in a community chat and AI agents plus a human maintainer fix them through Switch.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm test        # Vitest + Supertest
npm start       # http://localhost:3000
```

## Storefront

A small React shop (`web/`) that uses the API through Vite's `/api` proxy:

```bash
npm run web:install
npm run web     # http://localhost:5173 (needs the API running on :3000)
```

Set `VITE_COMMUNITY_URL` to your Discord invite to link the "Something look wrong?" footer.

## Try it

```bash
curl -s -X POST localhost:3000/carts                                   # {"id":"c_1",...}
curl -s -X POST localhost:3000/carts/c_1/items -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"productId":"p_2"}'
curl -s -X POST localhost:3000/carts/c_1/coupon -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"code":"SAVE10"}'
curl -s localhost:3000/carts/c_1/total
```
